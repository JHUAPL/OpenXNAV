*Open-source modular toolkit for simulating high-fidelity pulsar X-ray events.* 


### **Introduction**

OpenXNAV is designed to aid development and testing of Pulsar-based Autonomous Navigation (XNAV) Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solutions.

This is a flexible, cost-effective testbed to enable the next generation of XNAV solutions. OpenXNAV includes three modular components that allow engineers simulate high-fidelity pulsar X-ray events along a flight trajectory over a user-defined mission timeline.
<br />

### **Components**

* [Pulsar Querying](components/1__pulsar_querying/pq_overview.md)
* [Mission Planning](components/2__mission_planning/mp_overview.md)
* [Timing & Event Generation](components/3__custom_event_generation/ceg_overview.md)
* [Hardware In The Loop](components/3__custom_event_generation/ceg_overview.md#hardware-in-the-loop-sdrs)
<br />

Users can query for pulsar candidates using the query tool component (powered by the [ATNF Pulsar Catalogue](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/)). Mission planning for a desired trajectory can be done with our open-source mission planning tool, or via the commercial Ansys System Tool Kit (STK) if desired. X-Ray events can then be generated using our Timing & Event Generation component, and these pulses can (optionally) be simulated in hardware using software-defined radios (SDRs).
